# UserManagementSystem
Project is currectly under development and new features will be added, when they are ready.
Idea of project is to enter employee data like name, department and position. That data will be stored in hibernate entities, where it will be transfered to postgresql database. In database information will be filtered to match data to correct table. User is also capable to search data from database and retrieve it back from database. I'm currently creating API to handle interactions with data retrieval
